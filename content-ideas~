- Our Roots: Despite popular belief, Sollia doesn’t mean sun in a foreign language. Rather, the name was constructed from a combination of the small Italian towns, Solano and Melia, which are the respective origins of owners Nina and Rocco Bueti. In the spirit of these towns, Sollia Salon is a family run business and prides itself upon carrying out the Italian ideal of treating all of our clients like family. We will never forget our roots and we can promise our professional team of stylists won’t forget yours.
